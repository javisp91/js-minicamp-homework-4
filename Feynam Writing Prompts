Callback Functions: functions that are nested within functions.
Closure: when a function gets returned, it remember the scope from where it was written.
arguments array: a way to reach all the arguments passed to a function.
recursion: another way to iterate.
prototype: the mother object of all JavaScript objects.
constructors: functions that set up the blueprint for instances of an object.
